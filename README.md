# PastPresence / Echoes of Indiana – Site Notes

## Purpose
This repository currently hosts the **stakeholder-facing pitch site** for the project originally called *Oracle Entities*.

The site now uses:
- **Echoes of Indiana** as the flagship installation name.
- **PastPresence** as the overarching platform identity.

## What's New
- A **"Broader Vision"** page has been added. This outlines how PastPresence could expand (e.g., *Echoes of Uppsala*, *Echoes of Appalachia*, *Echoes of the Internet Archive*). It frames the Indiana installation as the first of many, for funders and partners to see the larger picture.

## Next Steps
- This site will remain **internal / pitch-focused** for funders and stakeholders.
- A **separate public-facing site** will be built later — clean, studio-style, and aimed at museums, universities, and corporate partners.
- All brand research, naming strategy, and competitive analysis (see `OracleEntities_Business_Report.md`) should be referenced for that build.

## Tone
- Do NOT make this site overly "corporate" — keep its informal, in-progress feel.
- New additions (PastPresence mentions, "Broader Vision" page) are **add-ons** not rewrites.

## Files
- `OracleEntities_Business_Report.md` – contains research, naming strategy, competitor landscape.
- This README – guidance for developers/designers updating the site.
