# Oracle Entity FAQ Pairs

**Q:** What is the Oracle Entity Project?
**A:** An interactive AI installation where visitors converse with Indiana's historical figures through holographic displays. Using particle-based avatars and natural voice interaction, the Oracle brings figures like Vonnegut, Kinsey, and Madam C.J. Walker to life.

**Q:** How does the holographic display work?
**A:** We use Pepper's Ghost illusion with a 14ft×9ft foil plane at 45° angle. A hidden projector creates particle-based avatars that appear to float in space. The dark environment and proper viewing distance create convincing 3D presence.

**Q:** What technology powers the conversations?
**A:** ASR→GPT-4→TTS pipeline with <1.5s response times. Whisper processes speech, GPT-4 generates persona responses, ElevenLabs creates authentic voices. Real-time particle systems respond to audio for living presence.

**Q:** Which Indiana figures are featured?
**A:** Kurt Vonnegut (primary), Alfred Kinsey, Madam C.J. Walker, Hoagy Carmichael, and others. Each has unique particle signatures - Vonnegut shows smoke wisps, Kinsey displays data points, Walker has Art Deco flourishes.

**Q:** How much does implementation cost?
**A:** Tier 1: $62K (enhanced display), Tier 2: $170K (full kiosk), Tier 3: $210K (premium holographic). Alternative tracks from $77K-$297K depending on scope and technology choices.

**Q:** What's the project timeline?
**A:** Tiered approach: Months 1-6 foundation, 7-15 enhancement, 15-24 premium. Faster deployment possible with simpler display technologies or existing kiosk solutions.

**Q:** Where will it be installed?
**A:** Targeting Bloomington's Showers Brothers Tech District, IU campus, or partner museums. Designed for both permanent installations and touring deployments.

**Q:** How accurate are the historical conversations?
**A:** RAG system uses verified historical documents, academic sources, and estate-approved materials where possible. AI admits uncertainty and cites sources for transparency.

**Q:** What makes this different from other AI chatbots?
**A:** Immersive holographic presence with environmental lighting, particle aesthetics, and authentic voice cloning. Focus on Indiana heritage with deep historical research and academic partnerships.

**Q:** How do visitors interact with the Oracle?
**A:** Natural speech through beam-forming microphones. Motion detection triggers persona materialization. Conversation flows naturally with visual feedback through particle animations.

**Q:** What's the Pepper's Ghost specification?
**A:** 14ft×9ft foil plane, 8ft×8ft visible image, 8ft viewer standoff, 10-12K lumen laser projector, <50 lux ambient lighting, matte black cavity with mask wall.

**Q:** Can multiple people use it simultaneously?
**A:** Tier 3 supports group interactions with intelligent crowd management. Lower tiers optimize for single-user conversations with queue management for busy periods.

**Q:** What's the particle design language?
**A:** Cyan/teal primary particles (#00CED1), golden accents (#FFD700), persona-specific behaviors. Particles coalesce into faces during conversation, dissolve during idle states.

**Q:** How is content kept historically accurate?
**A:** Collaboration with IU Lilly Library, local historians, and community advisory panels. Retrieval-augmented generation with verified source materials and transparent citation.

**Q:** What happens if the AI systems fail?
**A:** Local fallback models, pre-recorded responses, graceful "glitch" state with particle animations. Multiple redundancy layers ensure continuous operation during outages.

**Q:** Is this suitable for public deployment?
**A:** Yes, museum-grade hardware with 24/7 operation capability. Professional installation, maintenance contracts, remote monitoring, and staff training included.

**Q:** How long are typical conversations?
**A:** Target 4+ minutes average (vs 2 minutes for traditional displays). Natural conversation flow with persona-appropriate responses and visitor engagement tracking.

**Q:** What software platforms are used?
**A:** TouchDesigner for particles, Unity/Unreal for 3D rendering, OpenAI/ElevenLabs APIs, Whisper ASR, custom conversation management, and state machine control systems.

**Q:** Can it be customized for other locations?
**A:** Modular architecture enables replication with location-specific personas and content. System designed for scalability across multiple institutions and regions.

**Q:** What's the power and space requirements?
**A:** 30-40A dedicated circuits, ≥11ft ceiling clearance, 20-22ft total depth, climate control for projectors, low ambient lighting (<50 lux at foil plane).

**Q:** How is visitor privacy protected?
**A:** Anonymous interaction logging, no personal data storage, GDPR-compliant processing. Focus on conversation content for system improvement, not user identification.

**Q:** What academic partnerships exist?
**A:** IU School of Informatics for AI research, Lilly Library for historical verification, student service-learning opportunities, ongoing content development collaboration.

**Q:** How often is content updated?
**A:** Quarterly source updates, continuous FAQ expansion based on visitor interactions, annual major content reviews, seasonal special programming additions.

**Q:** What's the environmental impact?
**A:** LED lighting systems, efficient laser projectors, local processing to reduce cloud dependency, sustainable hardware choices, minimal physical footprint.

**Q:** Can personas discuss controversial topics?
**A:** Balanced historical perspectives with community oversight. Admits complexity, avoids absolute political endorsements, redirects harmful content, maintains educational focus.

**Q:** What's the audience age range?
**A:** All ages with adaptive responses. Age-appropriate content, simplified explanations for children, scholarly depth for academics, intuitive interaction for all visitors.

**Q:** How realistic do the personas appear?
**A:** Ethereal particle aesthetic creates magical presence without uncanny valley issues. Focus on consciousness emerging from light rather than photorealistic appearance.

**Q:** What backup systems exist?
**A:** Dual projectors for brightness/redundancy, local AI models, cached responses, multiple TTS options, automated restart systems, remote monitoring capabilities.

**Q:** How is the installation maintained?
**A:** Quarterly service visits, spare parts inventory, staff training, remote diagnostics, automated health monitoring, cleaning protocols, performance optimization.

**Q:** What's the educational value?
**A:** Interactive Indiana history, engaging humanities education, research methodology demonstration, AI literacy, interdisciplinary learning opportunities.

**Q:** Can it integrate with existing museum systems?
**A:** Yes, modular design with standard AV connections, ticketing system integration, analytics compatibility, accessibility compliance, multilingual capability planning.

**A:** Graceful degradation, visual feedback during processing, "glitch" aesthetic masks delays, local fallbacks, automated recovery systems, immediate staff notification.

**Q:** What's the long-term vision?
**A:** Expand to multiple Indiana locations, additional historical figures, touring installations, educational partnerships, open-source components for broader adoption.

**Q:** How do visitors know when to speak?
**A:** Visual cues through particle behavior, audio prompts, clear conversation states, intuitive interaction design, staff guidance during busy periods.
