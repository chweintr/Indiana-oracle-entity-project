## Walk-Up Choreography

**Approach** – A soft teal glow beckons from the Oracle platform. A floor-flush bronze disc (Ø 1 m) subtly illuminates when stepped on, signaling the system's attention.

**Capture** – Beamforming microphone array plus depth camera create a rim-light halo, centering focus on the visitor while filtering ambient noise down to -48 dB.

**Dialogue** – Visitor speaks their question to Indiana's past. The Entity responds through directional speakers, voice synthesized using ElevenLabs cloning technology to match the chosen persona's authentic speech patterns.

**Morph** – When switching personas, the current entity dissolves into a mesmerizing "Fragments" particle swirl using Unreal Engine's Niagara system, then re-coalesces as the new figure in under 1 second.

**Release** – Ten seconds of silence or moving 1 meter laterally frees the microphone for the next visitor, ensuring smooth crowd flow.

## Personality Rights & Implementation Strategy

<div class="my-8 bg-gray-800 border border-gray-600 rounded-lg p-6 text-white">

### Permissions & Estate Relations (UPDATED)

The Oracle Entity Project operates with full respect for personality rights and estate wishes. Our implementation strategy includes:

**For Historical Figures:**
- Formal requests to literary estates (Vonnegut Estate, etc.)
- Collaboration with family representatives and legal counsel
- Revenue sharing agreements where appropriate
- Academic fair use considerations for educational contexts

**For Living Personalities:**
- Direct consultation and approval processes
- Ongoing collaboration and content oversight
- Flexible participation models (full endorsement to limited licensing)
- Clear attribution and respectful representation standards

### Robust Fallback Framework

**Primary Experience:** The **Indiana Sage** and complementary foundational personas ensure compelling visitor experiences regardless of celebrity participation status.

**Modular Design:** Individual personality modules can be activated, modified, or retired without affecting core Oracle functionality.

**Educational Focus:** All interactions prioritize historical education, cultural preservation, and civic engagement — values that transcend any single personality.

**Community-Driven Content:** Local historians, educators, and cultural leaders provide authentic Indiana perspectives that form the Oracle's knowledge foundation.

<p class="text-sm text-white mt-4">
<strong>The Oracle's mission — connecting visitors with Indiana's rich history and culture — remains compelling whether enhanced by celebrity personas or powered entirely by our foundational Indiana voices.</strong>
