# The Oracle Experience

## Visitor Journey

## Walk-Up Choreography

**Approach** – The Oracle platform has a teal light. A bronze disc in the floor lights up when someone steps on it.

**Capture** – Microphone array and depth camera focus on the visitor. Background noise reduced to -48 dB.

**Dialogue** – Visitor asks a question. The Oracle responds through directional speakers using ElevenLabs voice synthesis to match the persona's speech patterns.

**Morph** – Personas change through particle effects built in Unreal Engine. The transitions cover processing time while loading the next figure.

**Release** – Ten seconds of silence or stepping away resets the system for the next visitor.

## Legal Process (Proposed for Post-Funding)

<div class="my-8 bg-gray-800 border border-gray-600 rounded-lg p-6 text-white">

### Rights Clearance Strategy (If Funded)

**Note**: No contact has been initiated with estates or individuals at this point. Only the general Indiana Oracle is trained, with one persona as proof of concept (not public). 

**If the project receives funding, the process would include:**

- Engaging intellectual property attorneys specializing in personality rights
- Working through university intermediaries if funding comes from IU
- Establishing formal contact protocols with estates and representatives
- Developing revenue-sharing proposals where appropriate

**Proposed approach for different persona types:**

**For Historical Figures:**
- University legal departments to initiate formal estate contact
- IP attorneys to negotiate likeness rights
- Academic fair use evaluation for educational contexts
- Clear usage boundaries and content guidelines

**For Living Personalities:**
- Direct consultation through professional representatives
- Formal licensing agreements
- Ongoing approval processes for content
- Flexible participation models based on comfort level

### Fallback Framework

**Primary Experience:** The **Indiana Sage** and complementary foundational personas provide compelling visitor experiences regardless of celebrity participation status.

**Modular Design:** Individual personality modules can be activated, modified, or retired without affecting core Oracle functionality.

**Educational Focus:** All interactions prioritize historical education, cultural preservation, and civic engagement — values that transcend any single personality.

**Community-Driven Content:** Local historians, educators, and cultural leaders provide authentic Indiana perspectives that form the Oracle's knowledge foundation.

**Regional Persona Library:** Beyond historical figures, the system supports Indiana archetypes representing the state's diverse character — the limestone worker, the family farmer, the cycling enthusiast, the outdoor adventurer. These personas capture authentic Hoosier experiences and regional wisdom, adding depth to conversations regardless of celebrity participation.

<p class="text-sm text-white mt-4">
<strong>The Oracle's mission — connecting visitors with Indiana's rich history and culture — remains compelling whether featuring celebrity personas or powered entirely by our foundational Indiana voices.</strong>
