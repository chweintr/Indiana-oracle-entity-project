# Beyond Indiana: The PastPresence Vision

Echoes of Indiana is the first installation of PastPresence, a project that creates interactive holographic conversations. The success of the Bloomington project has led the LLC to be approached by institutions and civic groups interested in similar work under the same branding.

## Possible Future Echoes Projects

These examples are not active projects, but they show how the Echoes model could extend:

<div class="space-y-8 my-12">

### Echoes of Uppsala
A university might commission an interactive archive drawn from its scholarship, allowing visitors to speak with past academics, artists, and scientists.

### Echoes of Appalachia
A civic group could fund a project focused on local storytellers, cultural figures, and community histories.

### Echoes of the Internet Archive
A library or foundation might support a holographic guide trained on a vast digital archive to present material conversationally rather than through static searches.

</div>

Each installation would feature personas specific to that location or collection.

    Support for Echoes of Indiana helps establish the model for future installations while creating the first working example of the technology.
