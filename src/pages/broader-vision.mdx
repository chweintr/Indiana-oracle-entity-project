# Beyond Indiana: The PastPresence Vision

Echoes of Indiana is the flagship installation of PastPresence, an initiative bringing history to life through interactive holographic conversations. This first project was made possible through the support of Indiana funders, partners, and cultural institutions — and it represents just the beginning of what PastPresence can become.

## Future Echoes Projects

PastPresence is designed as a framework for future "Echoes" projects:

<div class="space-y-8 my-12">

### Echoes of Uppsala
An interactive archive drawn from centuries of university scholarship, allowing visitors to engage with the voices of academics, artists, and scientists.

### Echoes of Appalachia
Conversations with regional storytellers, cultural figures, and community histories.

### Echoes of the Internet Archive
A holographic guide trained on one of the world's richest digital libraries, capable of surfacing knowledge in a way no static search tool can.

</div>

Each Echoes project will feature unique, carefully curated personas — some drawn from the past, some living — embodied through holographic AI experiences.

    Support for Echoes of Indiana doesn't just make one project possible. It lays the groundwork for a network of Echoes installations and an ongoing partnership with the institutions and visionaries who helped bring the first oracle to life.
