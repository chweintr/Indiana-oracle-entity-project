# Beyond Indiana: The PastPresence Vision

Echoes of Indiana is the first installation of PastPresence, a project creating interactive holographic conversations that bring history into public spaces. Indiana funders, partners, and cultural institutions supported this launch, which opens the door to a wider series of Echoes projects.

## Future Echoes Projects

PastPresence provides the framework for other Echoes projects:

<div class="space-y-8 my-12">

### Echoes of Uppsala
An archive drawn from centuries of university scholarship, letting visitors speak with the voices of academics, artists, and scientists.

### Echoes of Appalachia
Dialogues with regional storytellers, cultural figures, and community histories.

### Echoes of the Internet Archive
A holographic guide trained on one of the world's largest digital libraries, surfacing knowledge in ways static searches cannot.

</div>

Each project will feature distinct personas, some drawn from history and others still living, embodied through holographic AI.

    Support for Echoes of Indiana builds more than one project. It creates the foundation for a network of Echoes installations and ongoing work with the institutions and people who helped shape the first oracle.
