# Education, Dialogue, Preservation

## Educational Use

The Oracle Entity is located at the Showers District site. It was developed to support direct engagement with figures drawn from Indiana's history. The system is trained on primary materials, including archival documents, interviews, published works, and institutional records. Visitors speak to the Oracle and receive responses that reflect how those individuals spoke and thought, within the limits of available sources.

A person may study Larry Bird's biography or read Kurt Vonnegut's collected interviews, but the experience of hearing a voice respond in real time to a specific question is different. The system does not recreate the individual in full, but it presents a recognizable semblance based on documented language and ideas.

This is not a reenactment and not a performance. It is an interaction—open-ended, variable, and grounded in research. A question is asked. A response is generated. The value comes from what the visitor does with that exchange.

## In the Classroom

| Level | Use | Outcome |
|-------|-----|---------|
| Elementary | Storytelling with Indiana figures | Familiarity with regional history |
| Middle School | Source-based follow-up discussion | Reading comprehension and comparison |
| High School | Framing and discussion of complex topics | Preparation for analysis and argument |
| University | Collaborative annotation and critique | Research using generated dialogue |

## Research and Development (Ongoing and Aspirational)

This section describes possible directions under consideration. All timelines are contingent on available resources, viable hardware, and institutional support.

| Year | Focus | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Core installation in use | Showers District site |
| 2 | Mobile companion application | Designed for smartphone or tablet use |
| 3 | Wearable display prototypes | Limited pilot studies only |
| 4 | Display system research | Dependent on hardware development |
| 5 | Broader access model | Conditional on infrastructure |

## Evaluation and Metrics

| Area | Sample Metrics |
|------|----------------|
| Visitor Use | Conversation length, repeat visitors |
| Educational Value | Work samples, qualitative feedback, curriculum use |
| Community Reach | School partnerships, attendance at public programs |
| Technical Use | Platform engagement, app usage patterns |
| Public Interest | Citations, press coverage, replication inquiries |

## Maintenance, Governance, and Continuity

### System Design
- Modular components allow for staged hardware and software updates
- System is designed to avoid dependency on any single vendor
- Documentation is maintained for continuity and transfer

### Content and Update Cycle

| Frequency | Task | Responsibility |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Quarterly | Historical review and citation check | Historical consultants |
| Bi-annually | Persona expansion and testing | Studio development team |
| Annually | Technical audit and review | AV and engineering partners |
| Ongoing | Review of visitor input and feedback | On-site program staff |

### Financial Structure
- Phase 1: Initial development funded through public and private grants
- Phase 2: Ongoing operational support through educational partnerships
- Phase 3: Licensing or replication model may be introduced where appropriate
- Phase 4: Corporate or philanthropic partnerships considered for future expansion

### Stewardship and Ownership
- Years 1–2: Project team maintains full operational control
- Years 3–5: Gradual transition to local oversight and staffing
- Year 6 onward: Fully maintained by regional partners, with advisory support as needed

## Longevity and Use Over Time

The Oracle Entity is structured to adapt without replacement. Content updates, hardware revisions, and interface changes can be implemented without dismantling the core system. Educational programs will evolve alongside institutional priorities and public interest.

Historical accuracy is maintained through academic partnerships. Visual and technical systems are documented and updatable. Public engagement is sustained through school integration, ongoing workshops, and collaboration with community groups.

The system is not locked to a moment in time. It is built to change, respond, and remain useful.
