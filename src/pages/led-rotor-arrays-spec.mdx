## Room & Display Requirements

**Display Configuration**  
- Multiple synchronized units for larger displays  
- Individual units: **65 to 100 cm diameter** rotating LED arrays  
- Total display area: **8 ft × 8 ft** effective viewing area achievable with array  
- Viewing angle: **Up to 180°** with proper configuration  
- **360° viewing possible** with specialized mounting arrangements  

**Installation Flexibility**  
- **Wall-mounted**: Direct installation on walls with minimal depth  
- **Ceiling-suspended**: Floating appearance from above  
- **Free-standing**: Pedestal or frame mounting for portable setups  
- **No projection pit required**: Significant space savings vs Pepper's Ghost  

**Environmental Requirements**  
- Ambient lighting: **Works in up to 300 lux** (vs 50 lux for Pepper's Ghost)  
- Sound considerations: **~60 dB** operational noise with baffling  
- Temperature: Standard indoor climate control sufficient  
- Power: **2 to 3 kW** for full array system
