# Implementation Strategy

## Tiered Development Approach

We've developed a three-tier implementation plan that balances vision with practical steps, 
allowing growth from prototype to full installation.

---

## Real-Time Pipeline Architecture (Powers ALL Display Options)
**Timeline:** 8 weeks | **Budget:** ~\$35-\$55K | **Latency:** &lt;1 second glass-to-glass

<div class="mb-8 p-6 bg-brand-teal/10 rounded-lg border border-brand-teal/30">

### The Magic is in the Real-Time Response
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Sub-1-second response creates truly conversational experience

- **Total Latency**: 300-500ms achievable on optimized pipeline

### Display Technology Options

The project is exploring two primary display technologies, with a growing preference for holographic LED rotor arrays:

#### Option A: Holographic LED Rotor Arrays (Leading Approach)
- **Synchronized LED rotor systems** that create full-motion 3D visuals appearing to hover in space
- **Bright, high-definition visuals** that remain visible in mixed lighting conditions
- **No projection pit required** - more flexible placement and scalable for walls or touring
- **360° viewing possible** with some configurations
- **Best for**: Modern installations seeking clear visuals and flexible setup

#### Option B: Pepper's Ghost (Traditional Alternative)
- **14ft × 9ft foil at 45°** for 8ft × 8ft visible image
- **10-12K lumen projector** in concealed pit
- **Classic theatrical illusion** with proven reliability
- **Best for**: Museum installations with controlled lighting and dedicated space

Both technologies support the same magical particle-based Oracle experience, with LED rotor arrays offering advantages in brightness, flexibility, and modern aesthetic appeal.

## Display Technology Options

Analysis of holographic display approaches, from recommended to experimental:

### A. Pepper's Ghost (Projection Pit) — Recommended
- **Bright continuous image** from a hidden screen
- **Real blacks, no visible pixel grid** — clean image quality
- **Needs depth, masking, and single sweet viewing zone** — architectural requirements
- **Not walk-in** unless we add a second foil (messy, low contrast)
- **Best for**: Permanent installations with space and lighting control

### B. Transparent LED "Hologram" Panels (AVLink, etc.)
- **Thin, hangable, survives brighter rooms** — environmental flexibility
- **LED lattice and gray "off" state visible** at 6–8 ft viewing distance
- **Works as hidden emitter** inside a PG bay; weak as the hero surface
- **Best for**: Backup technology or bright ambient environments

### C. Scrim / Gauze Projection (Hologauze, Holonet)
- **Big scale, cheap, fast rig** — rapid deployment option
- **Looks foggy without hard light control** — blacks go milky
- **Softer edges than PG** — less crisp image quality
- **Best for**: Temporary installations or budget-constrained projects

### D. Boxed "Holo" Cabinets (Proto/Portl Style)
- **Turnkey, self-contained** — minimal site preparation
- **Reads like fancy TV in a box** up close; shallow depth illusion
- **Good satellite piece, not the main Oracle** — secondary installations
- **Best for**: Touring demos or quick deployment while main build happens

### E. Holographic LED Rotor Arrays (Small Scale)
- **Novel, some operational noise, lower pixel density at scale** — limited for large faces
- **Safety considerations, challenging for crisp 8 ft face** — better for entry displays
- **Best for**: Entry attraction displays or smaller supplementary installations

### F. True Light-Field / Multi-View (Looking Glass 65, SolidLight)
- **Real parallax, tiny viewing cone** — limited audience
- **Seven-figure cost and content headaches** — not practical for public installation
- **Not viable for 8 ft public head today** — technology not mature enough
- **Best for**: Research demonstrations only

## Implementation Strategy

### "Enterability" Considerations
We could put visitors inside the bay with a second foil, but reflections stack and contrast dies. **Better approach**: keep the vitrine sealed, let viewers approach the front edge, never see the pit.

### Our Recommendation
**Keep the projection PG pit as the hero.** Use transparent LED only as a hidden emitter if projector logistics collapse. If we want a lighter second install elsewhere, a Proto-style cabinet or transparent LED frame can echo the main piece without the pit.

### The "Vitrine" Aesthetic

Regardless of display technology, we want a cube/vitrine presence without killing contrast:

- **Front face:** Clear or AR-coated glass/acrylic
- **Sides/back:** Matte black or smoked panels to kill reflections
- **Interior illusion:** Dim faux room/cube behind the head—barely visible geometry to sell depth without fighting the foil

**Visual Layer Management** (front → back):
1. **Environmental particles** (always active)
2. **Avatar/head** (conversation-driven)
3. **Persona particles** (sentiment-reactive)
4. **Spatial context** (faux interior geometry, &lt;20% luminance)
5. **Background void** (pure black for contrast)

## Option A: Display Technology Path

### Practical Implementation Guide

<div class="mb-8">

### Pepper's Ghost (Projection) — Recommended

**Why:** Bright, large image, true blacks, cheap per square foot. Real-time feed from Unreal/TouchDesigner or straight video.

    📋 Full Technical Specifications & Build Requirements
  </a>
</div>

**What the atrium must give us:**
- **Depth behind/under foil:** ≥ 6 ft clear (projector + black cavity)
- **Low ambient light at foil plane:** ≤ 50 lux. Plan baffling/hoods or blackout spill baffles
- **Footprint:** 14 ft wide foil plane = 8 ft × 8 ft visible image → foil frame 14 × 9 ft
- **Projector:** 10–12K lumen laser (Epson Pro L1200U + ELPLU03S 0.65–0.75:1 or Panasonic PT-RZ990 + ET-DLE060 0.6–0.8:1)
- **Lens shift:** ±50% vertical, ±20% horizontal
- **Black box:** velvet/DarkMat lining, service access door, HVAC dust control
- **Viewing stand-off:** 8 ft minimum (6 ft absolute minimum) to hide edges
- **Mask wall:** 2–2.5 ft high, matte black, blocks ground screen sightlines
- **Viewer eye height:** 5 ft 6 in design standard
- **Platform build-up:** 24 in OR 24–36 in recess option
- **Latency budget:** &lt;700 ms end-to-end
- **Cleaning:** anti-static microfiber, no ammonia, quick-swap foil frame

**Pipeline:** Throw path: projector → ground screen → foil → viewer. Mic → STT/LLM/TTS → visemes/emotion JSON → render on black → projector → foil. Hue/DMX pulses bounce off walls/ceiling, never the foil.

---

### Pepper's Ghost (Screen Reflection) — Backup

Use a 55–98″ OLED at 45° if you can't get throw depth. Faster install, shallower cavity. You fight: bezels, lower brightness, "not quite black" blacks. Good for PoC or tight spaces.

---

### Holographic LED Rotor Arrays — Entry Attraction Display

Strategic placement of holographic LED rotor arrays at venue entrances creates an ethereal preview of the Oracle experience. These synchronized LED rotor systems create full-motion 3D visuals that appear to hover in space, drawing visitors toward the main installation.

**Implementation:** Glass-enclosed holographic LED rotor units display a looping 15-20 second sequence: "The Oracle is speaking inside" with subtle particle effects that echo the main experience. The floating text and abstract visuals create intrigue without revealing the full Oracle interaction.

**Technical Integration:** Pre-rendered content optimized for holographic display, with potential for real-time status updates showing when the Oracle is actively engaged with visitors.

### Construction Ask (put this in the architect brief)
- **Reserve a projection bay:** 6 ft deep × width of foil, full blackout
- **Provide power & ventilation** for 1–2 projectors (≈1.0–1.5 kW each) and a workstation
- **Mounting points** for a tensioned 45° foil frame (or beamsplitter glass, if permanent)
- **Lighting zones:** independent dimming near the vitrine; DMX/Hue-ready circuits
- **Cable paths** (SDI/DP, Cat6 for NDI) and service access (front and rear)

---

### B) Detailed Technical Playbook — Pepper's Ghost (and Adjacent) Path

#### 1. Define objectives and scale

* Decide: **home PoC**, **temporary pilot**, or **museum‑grade install**. That choice sets foil type, projector class, rigging method, budget, and compliance burden.
* Write the target image size in feet/meters first. Everything propagates from that (throw distance, lumen count, frame size).

#### 2. Pick the reflective medium

* **Hologauze (Holotronica/Gerriets):** woven, silver‑coated mesh. Nearly invisible unlit. Low gain (~0.15). Needs high‑lumen projection. Widths to ~7.4 m.
* **Metallised polyethylene foil ("Musion/Eyeliner" class):** higher gain (~2), ~97 % transmittance / 20 % reflectance. Cheap (≈\$150–\$200 / m²) but wrinkle‑prone.
* **Mirror films (Glimm, etc.):** 2–8 m widths, supplied with frames. Mid‑price, decent reflectance.
* **Beamsplitter glass (JNS 50/50):** permanent installs. Heavy, expensive, scratch‑resistant, no wrinkles.

Choose on: portability, life expectancy, and image quality. Foil for prototypes, glass for permanent.

#### 3. Geometry & footprint

* Foil/glass at **45°** to the floor. Projector image reflects toward viewers.
* For a ~10 ft vitrine, reserve **≥6 ft** of depth behind/below the foil for projector + black box.
* Viewer stand‑off: **≥6–8 ft** to block sightlines past the foil edge. Center the head at ~5 ft eye height.
* Use tensioned frames or truss; quick‑release framing saves you during maintenance.
* Line the cavity with **black velvet/DarkMat** to kill stray light.

#### 4. Projector selection & placement

* Target **≥50 ft‑L** on screen for museum lighting; back‑solve lumens after film gain losses. 10–12 k lm laser projectors are typical for a 6 × 10 ft image in dim conditions. 5 k lm is fine for PoC in a dark room.
* Prefer **short‑throw (≈0.8:1)** with **±50–60 % vertical, ±20–23 % horizontal lens shift**. UST saves space but usually lacks shift and brightness.
* Two blended projectors = brightness + redundancy (optional mid/high tiers).
* Pick 24/7‑rated, filter‑free laser units to cut maintenance.

#### 5. Media pipeline (real‑time or near‑real‑time)

* **Server:** TouchDesigner, Notch, Resolume, or Unreal/Unity direct.
* **Ingress:** NDI / NDI HX3 for IP video; Spout for GPU texture pass‑through on Windows.
* **Egress:** SDI or DisplayPort to projector. Avoid long HDMI runs.
* **Latency budget:** aim &lt;50 ms screen delay for interactive cues. Keep audio‑video offset within ±20 ms.
* **Fallback:** if LLM or TTS lags, cut to a "thinking swirl" loop.

#### 6. Lighting design

* Keep ambient **≤50 lux** at the foil plane. Black drapes, hoods, or baffles. Block sunlight.
* DMX or Hue fixtures can still pulse, but keep beams **off the foil surface**. Bounce from ceiling/walls behind viewers.
* Narrow‑beam spots can light physical props inside the vitrine without washing the image.

#### 7. Maintenance & risk

* Film is fragile: gloves, rigid tubes, mild soap (ammonia‑free), microfiber only. Inspect for wrinkles, re‑tension as needed.
* Projectors: clean filters (if any) on schedule; monitor hours to avoid surprise downtime.
* Control HVAC. Drafts ripple foil, humidity fogs glass. Use desiccant packs in the cavity.
* Document everything: IPs, DMX universes, cue sheets, foil handling, restart procedures.

#### 8. Budget & phasing

* **Home PoC (&lt;\$5 k):** ~3 m² foil, 5 k lm short‑throw, truss frame, black cloth, Hue test lights, laptop.
* **Mid install (~\$45 k):** 10–12 k lm projector, Hologauze/foil, DarkMat, media server license, rigging, basic DMX/Hue, pro labor.
* **Museum (~\$100 k):** dual 10-12k lm projection blend, custom frames or glass, media server, DMX grid, redundancy, service contract.
* **Flagship (~\$150 k):** multiple surfaces, curved glass, robotics or tracking, building system integration, R&D buffer.

#### 8a. Implementation Steps

1. **Order foil, truss, projector, media server** — coordinate lead times
2. **Fabricate platform or excavate pit** — 24 in up OR 24–36 in down
3. **Hang foil frame at 45°** — tensioned with quick-release access
4. **Install ground screen/projector** — focus with lens shift (no digital warp)
5. **Light plot focusing and lux check** — verify ≤50 lux at foil plane
6. **Content test** — grayscale ramp → contrast → particle-head clip
7. **Commissioning checklist and sign-off** — full system verification

#### 9. Documentation & handover

* CAD drawings: foil angle, projector coordinates, sightlines.
* Network topology: NDI nodes, IP blocks, DMX universes.
* Maintenance docs: film cleaning, projector schedules, software backup path.
* Train staff: boot/shutdown, quick diagnostics, when to call support.
* Stock spares: extra foil, lamps/laser modules, filters, cables.

#### 10. Evaluate & iterate

* Gather visitor/staff feedback. Check brightness, realism, viewing angles.
* Test under different light conditions. Adjust content brightness, hue cues, particle density.
* Plan updates every 6–12 months: new personas, new FX loops, maintenance cycles.

### Alternative Display Technologies

#### Light‑Field / Multiview Option (Looking Glass, SolidLight)

**What it gives you:**
* True parallax without glasses; multiple viewers share the 3D cone.
* No black-level problem (backlit LCD).
* Self-contained hardware; minimal environmental control vs. Pepper's Ghost.

**Constraints:**
* Heavy GPU load (8K quilt render @ 45–100 views).
* Fixed viewing cone (~53° on Looking Glass); edge artifacts outside.
* Panels are heavy and need rigid mounting.

**Budget Bands:**
* 32″ unit: \$15–\$20K hardware + \$10–\$20K dev.
* 65″ unit: \$35–\$45K hardware + \$20–\$30K dev + heavy mount.

#### Transparent OLED Stack (Layered Glass Illusion)

**What it gives you:**
* Sleek, see-through aesthetic; thin build.
* Can layer multiple panes for pseudo-depth (particles front, face mid, back glow).

**Constraints:**
* Blacks are transparent; contrast drops in bright spaces.
* Layering = brightness loss + moiré risk.
* Units max at 55″ FHD today.

**Budget:** ~\$16K per panel, plus mounts and media server outputs.

### Vendor Categories

**Display Materials:** Specialized holographic films, beamsplitter glass, and projection surfaces from established AV suppliers.

**Projection Systems:** Professional-grade short-throw laser projectors with lens shift capabilities from major commercial display manufacturers.

**Integration Partners:** Museum-quality AV integration firms with experience in interactive installations.
