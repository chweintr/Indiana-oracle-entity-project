## Display Technology Options

We're considering four primary display approaches, each with distinct trade-offs for scale, deployment speed, and environmental requirements:

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 my-8">

<div class="bg-brand-navy/20 rounded-lg p-6 border border-brand-teal/30">
  <h3 class="text-brand-teal font-bold text-lg mb-3">1. Projection Pepper's Ghost (Recommended)</h3>
  <p class="text-sm mb-3">Foil/glass at 45Â°, laser projector hidden in a dark bay.</p>
  <div class="text-xs space-y-1">
    <div><strong>Pros:</strong> Largest scale, deepest blacks, full particle control</div>
    <div><strong>Cons:</strong> Needs 5-6 ft hidden depth and low ambient light</div>
    <div><strong>Best for:</strong> Permanent installations with space and lighting control</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="bg-brand-navy/20 rounded-lg p-6 border border-brand-magenta/30">
  <h3 class="text-brand-magenta font-bold text-lg mb-3">2. Custom "Hologram Box" (DIY Proto)</h3>
  <p class="text-sm mb-3">Bright 4K panel inside black enclosure reflecting off half-silvered mirror.</p>
  <div class="text-xs space-y-1">
    <div><strong>Pros:</strong> Shallow footprint, works in bright lobbies, custom format</div>
    <div><strong>Cons:</strong> Less contrast than projection, requires custom fabrication</div>
    <div><strong>Best for:</strong> Space-constrained venues with bright ambient lighting</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="bg-brand-navy/20 rounded-lg p-6 border border-brand-amber/30">
  <h3 class="text-brand-amber font-bold text-lg mb-3">3. Proto Unit (Off-the-Shelf)</h3>
  <p class="text-sm mb-3">Fastest deployment: ship, plug, stream.</p>
  <div class="text-xs space-y-1">
    <div><strong>Pros:</strong> Immediate deployment, proven technology, minimal setup</div>
    <div><strong>Cons:</strong> Fixed phone-booth format, limited optical control</div>
    <div><strong>Best for:</strong> Touring demos or quick deployment while main build happens</div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="bg-brand-navy/20 rounded-lg p-6 border border-gray-400/30">
  <h3 class="text-gray-300 font-bold text-lg mb-3">4. Transparent OLED Stack</h3>
  <p class="text-sm mb-3">Sleek glass look with true transparency.</p>
  <div class="text-xs space-y-1">
    <div><strong>Pros:</strong> Minimal footprint, elegant aesthetic, no depth requirements</div>
    <div><strong>Cons:</strong> Lower contrast in bright spaces, no real parallax</div>
    <div><strong>Best for:</strong> Venues that refuse depth and darkness requirements</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

### The "Vitrine" Aesthetic

Regardless of display technology, we want a cube/vitrine presence without killing contrast:

- **Front face:** Clear or AR-coated glass/acrylic
- **Sides/back:** Matte black or smoked panels to kill reflections
- **Interior illusion:** Dim faux room/cube behind the headâ€”barely visible geometry to sell depth without fighting the foil

**Visual Layer Management** (front â†’ back):
1. **Environmental particles** (always active)
2. **Avatar/head** (conversation-driven)
3. **Persona particles** (sentiment-reactive)
4. **Spatial context** (faux interior geometry, &lt;20% luminance)
5. **Background void** (pure black for contrast)

## Option A: Advanced Display Technology Path

### Practical Implementation Guide

<div class="mb-8">

### Pepper's Ghost (Projection) â€” Recommended

**Why:** Bright, large image, true blacks, cheap per square foot. Real-time feed from Unreal/TouchDesigner or straight video.

<div class="my-4">

  >
    ðŸ“‹ Full Technical Specifications & Build Requirements
  </a>
</div>

**What the atrium must give us:**
- **Depth behind/under foil:** â‰¥ 6 ft clear (projector + black cavity)
- **Low ambient light at foil plane:** â‰¤ 50 lux. Plan baffling/hoods or blackout spill baffles
- **Footprint:** 14 ft wide foil plane = 8 ft Ã— 8 ft visible image â†’ foil frame 14 Ã— 9 ft
- **Projector:** 10â€“12K lumen laser (Epson Pro L1200U + ELPLU03S 0.65â€“0.75:1 or Panasonic PT-RZ990 + ET-DLE060 0.6â€“0.8:1)
- **Lens shift:** Â±50% vertical, Â±20% horizontal
- **Black box:** velvet/DarkMat lining, service access door, HVAC dust control
- **Viewing stand-off:** 8 ft minimum (6 ft absolute minimum) to hide edges
- **Mask wall:** 2â€“2.5 ft high, matte black, blocks ground screen sightlines
- **Viewer eye height:** 5 ft 6 in design standard
- **Platform build-up:** 24 in OR 24â€“36 in recess option
- **Latency budget:** &lt;700 ms end-to-end
- **Cleaning:** anti-static microfiber, no ammonia, quick-swap foil frame

**Pipeline:** Throw path: projector â†’ ground screen â†’ foil â†’ viewer. Mic â†’ STT/LLM/TTS â†’ visemes/emotion JSON â†’ render on black â†’ projector â†’ foil. Hue/DMX pulses bounce off walls/ceiling, never the foil.

---

### Pepper's Ghost (Screen Reflection) â€” Backup

Use a 55â€“98â€³ OLED at 45Â° if you can't get throw depth. Faster install, shallower cavity. You fight: bezels, lower brightness, "not quite black" blacks. Good for PoC or tight spaces.

---

### HYPERVSN â€” Entry Attraction Display

Strategic placement of rotating LED holographic displays at venue entrances creates an ethereal preview of the Oracle experience. These fan-based arrays project floating 3D visuals that appear to hover in mid-air, drawing visitors toward the main installation.

**Implementation:** Glass-enclosed HYPERVSN units display a looping 15-20 second sequence: "The Oracle is speaking inside" with subtle particle effects that echo the main experience. The floating text and abstract visuals create intrigue without revealing the full Oracle interaction.

**Technical Integration:** Pre-rendered content optimized for holographic display, with potential for real-time status updates showing when the Oracle is actively engaged with visitors.

### Construction Ask (put this in the architect brief)
- **Reserve a projection bay:** 6 ft deep Ã— width of foil, full blackout
- **Provide power & ventilation** for 1â€“2 projectors (â‰ˆ1.0â€“1.5 kW each) and a workstation
- **Mounting points** for a tensioned 45Â° foil frame (or beamsplitter glass, if permanent)
- **Lighting zones:** independent dimming near the vitrine; DMX/Hue-ready circuits
- **Cable paths** (SDI/DP, Cat6 for NDI) and service access (front and rear)

### B) Detailed Technical Playbook â€” Pepper's Ghost (and Adjacent) Path

#### 1. Define objectives and scale

* Decide: **home PoC**, **temporary pilot**, or **museumâ€‘grade install**. That choice sets foil type, projector class, rigging method, budget, and compliance burden.
* Write the target image size in feet/meters first. Everything propagates from that (throw distance, lumen count, frame size).

#### 2. Pick the reflective medium

* **Hologauze (Holotronica/Gerriets):** woven, silverâ€‘coated mesh. Nearly invisible unlit. Low gain (~0.15). Needs highâ€‘lumen projection. Widths to ~7.4 m.
* **Metallised polyethylene foil ("Musion/Eyeliner" class):** higher gain (~2), ~97 % transmittance / 20 % reflectance. Cheap (â‰ˆ$150â€“200 / mÂ²) but wrinkleâ€‘prone.
* **Mirror films (Glimm, etc.):** 2â€“8 m widths, supplied with frames. Midâ€‘price, decent reflectance.
* **Beamsplitter glass (JNS 50/50):** permanent installs. Heavy, expensive, scratchâ€‘resistant, no wrinkles.

Choose on: portability, life expectancy, and image quality. Foil for prototypes, glass for permanent.

#### 3. Geometry & footprint

* Foil/glass at **45Â°** to the floor. Projector image reflects toward viewers.
* For a ~10 ft vitrine, reserve **â‰¥6 ft** of depth behind/below the foil for projector + black box.
* Viewer standâ€‘off: **â‰¥6â€“8 ft** to block sightlines past the foil edge. Center the head at ~5 ft eye height.
* Use tensioned frames or truss; quickâ€‘release framing saves you during maintenance.
* Line the cavity with **black velvet/DarkMat** to kill stray light.

#### 4. Projector selection & placement

* Target **â‰¥50 ftâ€‘L** on screen for museum lighting; backâ€‘solve lumens after film gain losses. 10â€“12 k lm laser projectors are typical for a 6 Ã— 10 ft image in dim conditions. 5 k lm is fine for PoC in a dark room.
* Prefer **shortâ€‘throw (â‰ˆ0.8:1)** with **Â±50â€“60 % vertical, Â±20â€“23 % horizontal lens shift**. UST saves space but usually lacks shift and brightness.
* Two blended projectors = brightness + redundancy (optional mid/high tiers).
* Pick 24/7â€‘rated, filterâ€‘free laser units to cut maintenance.

#### 5. Media pipeline (realâ€‘time or nearâ€‘realâ€‘time)

* **Server:** TouchDesigner, Notch, Resolume, or Unreal/Unity direct.
* **Ingress:** NDI / NDI HX3 for IP video; Spout for GPU texture passâ€‘through on Windows.
* **Egress:** SDI or DisplayPort to projector. Avoid long HDMI runs.
* **Latency budget:** aim &lt;50 ms screen delay for interactive cues. Keep audioâ€‘video offset within Â±20 ms.
* **Fallback:** if LLM or TTS lags, cut to a "thinking swirl" loop.

#### 6. Lighting design

* Keep ambient **â‰¤50 lux** at the foil plane. Black drapes, hoods, or baffles. Block sunlight.
* DMX or Hue fixtures can still pulse, but keep beams **off the foil surface**. Bounce from ceiling/walls behind viewers.
* Narrowâ€‘beam spots can light physical props inside the vitrine without washing the image.

#### 7. Maintenance & risk

* Film is fragile: gloves, rigid tubes, mild soap (ammoniaâ€‘free), microfiber only. Inspect for wrinkles, reâ€‘tension as needed.
* Projectors: clean filters (if any) on schedule; monitor hours to avoid surprise downtime.
* Control HVAC. Drafts ripple foil, humidity fogs glass. Use desiccant packs in the cavity.
* Document everything: IPs, DMX universes, cue sheets, foil handling, restart procedures.

#### 8. Budget & phasing

* **Home PoC (&lt;$5 k):** ~3 mÂ² foil, 5 k lm shortâ€‘throw, truss frame, black cloth, Hue test lights, laptop.
* **Mid install (~$45 k):** 10â€“12 k lm projector, Hologauze/foil, DarkMat, media server license, rigging, basic DMX/Hue, pro labor.
* **Museum (~$100 k):** dual 10-12k lm projection blend, custom frames or glass, advanced media server, DMX grid, redundancy, service contract.
* **Flagship (~$150 k):** multiple surfaces, curved glass, robotics or tracking, building system integration, R&D buffer.

#### 8a. Implementation Steps

1. **Order foil, truss, projector, media server** â€” coordinate lead times
2. **Fabricate platform or excavate pit** â€” 24 in up OR 24â€“36 in down
3. **Hang foil frame at 45Â°** â€” tensioned with quick-release access
4. **Install ground screen/projector** â€” focus with lens shift (no digital warp)
5. **Light plot focusing and lux check** â€” verify â‰¤50 lux at foil plane
6. **Content test** â€” grayscale ramp â†’ contrast â†’ particle-head clip
7. **Commissioning checklist and sign-off** â€” full system verification

#### 9. Documentation & handover

* CAD drawings: foil angle, projector coordinates, sightlines.
* Network topology: NDI nodes, IP blocks, DMX universes.
* Maintenance docs: film cleaning, projector schedules, software backup path.
* Train staff: boot/shutdown, quick diagnostics, when to call support.
* Stock spares: extra foil, lamps/laser modules, filters, cables.

#### 10. Evaluate & iterate

* Gather visitor/staff feedback. Check brightness, realism, viewing angles.
* Test under different light conditions. Adjust content brightness, hue cues, particle density.
* Plan updates every 6â€“12 months: new personas, new FX loops, maintenance cycles.

### Alternative Display Technologies

#### Lightâ€‘Field / Multiview Option (Looking Glass, SolidLight)

**What it gives you:**
* True parallax without glasses; multiple viewers share the 3D cone.
* No black-level problem (backlit LCD).
* Self-contained hardware; minimal environmental control vs. Pepper's Ghost.

**Constraints:**
* Heavy GPU load (8K quilt render @ 45â€“100 views).
* Fixed viewing cone (~53Â° on Looking Glass); edge artifacts outside.
* Panels are heavy and need rigid mounting.

**Budget Bands:**
* 32â€³ unit: $15â€“20K hardware + $10â€“20K dev.
* 65â€³ unit: $35â€“45K hardware + $20â€“30K dev + heavy mount.

#### Transparent OLED Stack (Layered Glass Illusion)

**What it gives you:**
* Sleek, see-through aesthetic; thin build.
* Can layer multiple panes for pseudo-depth (particles front, face mid, back glow).

**Constraints:**
* Blacks are transparent; contrast drops in bright spaces.
* Layering = brightness loss + moirÃ© risk.
* Units max at 55â€³ FHD today.

**Budget:** ~$16K per panel, plus mounts and media server outputs.

### Vendor Categories

**Display Materials:** Specialized holographic films, beamsplitter glass, and projection surfaces from established AV suppliers.

**Projection Systems:** Professional-grade short-throw laser projectors with lens shift capabilities from major commercial display manufacturers.

**Integration Partners:** Museum-quality AV integration firms with experience in interactive installations.
