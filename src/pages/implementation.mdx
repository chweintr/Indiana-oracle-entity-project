## Option A: Advanced Display Technology Path

### Practical Implementation Guide

<div class="mb-8">

### Pepper's Ghost (Projection) — Recommended

**Why:** Bright, large image, true blacks, cheap per square foot. Real-time feed from Unreal/TouchDesigner or straight video.

**What the atrium must give us:**
- **Depth behind/under foil:** ≥ 6 ft clear (projector + black cavity)
- **Low ambient light at foil plane:** ≤ 50 lux. Plan baffling/hoods or dimmable zones
- **Footprint:** 10 ft wide head = ~6 ft tall image → foil frame ~12 × 8 ft
- **Projector:** 10–12K lumen laser, short-throw (~0.8:1) with lens shift. Two units blended if budget allows
- **Black box:** velvet/DarkMat lining, service access door, HVAC that won't ripple foil
- **Viewing stand-off:** 6–8 ft minimum to hide edges

**Pipeline:** Mic → STT/LLM/TTS → visemes/emotion JSON → render (engine or compositor) on black → projector → foil. Hue/DMX pulses bounce off walls/ceiling, never the foil.

---

### Pepper's Ghost (Screen Reflection) — Backup

Use a 55–98″ OLED at 45° if you can't get throw depth. Faster install, shallower cavity. You fight: bezels, lower brightness, "not quite black" blacks. Good for PoC or tight spaces.

---

### HYPERVSN — Entry Attraction Display

Strategic placement of rotating LED holographic displays at venue entrances creates an ethereal preview of the Oracle experience. These fan-based arrays project floating 3D visuals that appear to hover in mid-air, drawing visitors toward the main installation.

**Implementation:** Glass-enclosed HYPERVSN units display a looping 15-20 second sequence: "The Oracle is speaking inside" with subtle particle effects that echo the main experience. The floating text and abstract visuals create intrigue without revealing the full Oracle interaction.

**Technical Integration:** Pre-rendered content optimized for holographic display, with potential for real-time status updates showing when the Oracle is actively engaged with visitors.

---

### Construction Ask (put this in the architect brief)
- **Reserve a projection bay:** 6 ft deep × width of foil, full blackout
- **Provide power & ventilation** for 1–2 projectors (≈1.0–1.5 kW each) and a workstation
- **Mounting points** for a tensioned 45° foil frame (or beamsplitter glass, if permanent)
- **Lighting zones:** independent dimming near the vitrine; DMX/Hue-ready circuits
- **Cable paths** (SDI/DP, Cat6 for NDI) and service access (front and rear)

---

### B) Detailed Technical Playbook — Pepper's Ghost (and Adjacent) Path

#### 1. Define objectives and scale

* Decide: **home PoC**, **temporary pilot**, or **museum‑grade install**. That choice sets foil type, projector class, rigging method, budget, and compliance burden.
* Write the target image size in feet/meters first. Everything propagates from that (throw distance, lumen count, frame size).

#### 2. Pick the reflective medium

* **Hologauze (Holotronica/Gerriets):** woven, silver‑coated mesh. Nearly invisible unlit. Low gain (~0.15). Needs high‑lumen projection. Widths to ~7.4 m.
* **Metallised polyethylene foil ("Musion/Eyeliner" class):** higher gain (~2), ~97 % transmittance / 20 % reflectance. Cheap (≈$150–200 / m²) but wrinkle‑prone.
* **Mirror films (Glimm, etc.):** 2–8 m widths, supplied with frames. Mid‑price, decent reflectance.
* **Beamsplitter glass (JNS 50/50):** permanent installs. Heavy, expensive, scratch‑resistant, no wrinkles.

Choose on: portability, life expectancy, and image quality. Foil for prototypes, glass for permanent.

#### 3. Geometry & footprint

* Foil/glass at **45°** to the floor. Projector image reflects toward viewers.
* For a ~10 ft vitrine, reserve **≥6 ft** of depth behind/below the foil for projector + black box.
* Viewer stand‑off: **≥6–8 ft** to block sightlines past the foil edge. Center the head at ~5 ft eye height.
* Use tensioned frames or truss; quick‑release framing saves you during maintenance.
* Line the cavity with **black velvet/DarkMat** to kill stray light.

#### 4. Projector selection & placement

* Target **≥50 ft‑L** on screen for museum lighting; back‑solve lumens after film gain losses. 10–12 k lm laser projectors are typical for a 6 × 10 ft image in dim conditions. 5 k lm is fine for PoC in a dark room.
* Prefer **short‑throw (≈0.8:1)** with **±50–60 % vertical, ±20–23 % horizontal lens shift**. UST saves space but usually lacks shift and brightness.
* Two blended projectors = brightness + redundancy (optional mid/high tiers).
* Pick 24/7‑rated, filter‑free laser units to cut maintenance.

#### 5. Media pipeline (real‑time or near‑real‑time)

* **Server:** TouchDesigner, Notch, Resolume, or Unreal/Unity direct.
* **Ingress:** NDI / NDI HX3 for IP video; Spout for GPU texture pass‑through on Windows.
* **Egress:** SDI or DisplayPort to projector. Avoid long HDMI runs.
* **Latency budget:** aim &lt;50 ms screen delay for interactive cues. Keep audio‑video offset within ±20 ms.
* **Fallback:** if LLM or TTS lags, cut to a "thinking swirl" loop.

#### 6. Lighting design

* Keep ambient **≤50 lux** at the foil plane. Black drapes, hoods, or baffles. Block sunlight.
* DMX or Hue fixtures can still pulse, but keep beams **off the foil surface**. Bounce from ceiling/walls behind viewers.
* Narrow‑beam spots can light physical props inside the vitrine without washing the image.

#### 7. Maintenance & risk

* Film is fragile: gloves, rigid tubes, mild soap (ammonia‑free), microfiber only. Inspect for wrinkles, re‑tension as needed.
* Projectors: clean filters (if any) on schedule; monitor hours to avoid surprise downtime.
* Control HVAC. Drafts ripple foil, humidity fogs glass. Use desiccant packs in the cavity.
* Document everything: IPs, DMX universes, cue sheets, foil handling, restart procedures.

#### 8. Budget & phasing

* **Home PoC (&lt;$5 k):** ~3 m² foil, 5 k lm short‑throw, truss frame, black cloth, Hue test lights, laptop.
* **Mid install (~$45 k):** 10–12 k lm projector, Hologauze/foil, DarkMat, media server license, rigging, basic DMX/Hue, pro labor.
* **Museum (~$100 k):** 20 k lm projection or dual blend, custom frames or glass, advanced media server, DMX grid, redundancy, service contract.
* **Flagship (~$150 k):** multiple surfaces, curved glass, robotics or tracking, building system integration, R&D buffer.

#### 9. Documentation & handover

* CAD drawings: foil angle, projector coordinates, sightlines.
* Network topology: NDI nodes, IP blocks, DMX universes.
* Maintenance docs: film cleaning, projector schedules, software backup path.
* Train staff: boot/shutdown, quick diagnostics, when to call support.
* Stock spares: extra foil, lamps/laser modules, filters, cables.

#### 10. Evaluate & iterate

* Gather visitor/staff feedback. Check brightness, realism, viewing angles.
* Test under different light conditions. Adjust content brightness, hue cues, particle density.
* Plan updates every 6–12 months: new personas, new FX loops, maintenance cycles.

### Alternative Display Technologies

#### Light‑Field / Multiview Option (Looking Glass, SolidLight)

**What it gives you:**
* True parallax without glasses; multiple viewers share the 3D cone.
* No black-level problem (backlit LCD).
* Self-contained hardware; minimal environmental control vs. Pepper's Ghost.

**Constraints:**
* Heavy GPU load (8K quilt render @ 45–100 views).
* Fixed viewing cone (~53° on Looking Glass); edge artifacts outside.
* Panels are heavy and need rigid mounting.

**Budget Bands:**
* 32″ unit: $15–20K hardware + $10–20K dev.
* 65″ unit: $35–45K hardware + $20–30K dev + heavy mount.

#### Transparent OLED Stack (Layered Glass Illusion)

**What it gives you:**
* Sleek, see-through aesthetic; thin build.
* Can layer multiple panes for pseudo-depth (particles front, face mid, back glow).

**Constraints:**
* Blacks are transparent; contrast drops in bright spaces.
* Layering = brightness loss + moiré risk.
* Units max at 55″ FHD today.

**Budget:** ~$16K per panel, plus mounts and media server outputs.

### Vendor Categories

**Display Materials:** Specialized holographic films, beamsplitter glass, and projection surfaces from established AV suppliers.

**Projection Systems:** Professional-grade short-throw laser projectors with lens shift capabilities from major commercial display manufacturers.

**Integration Partners:** Museum-quality AV integration firms with experience in interactive installations.

**AI Platforms:** Conversational character SDKs and real-time avatar systems from leading AI companies.

*Detailed vendor contacts and specifications available through project consultation.*
