### 3. System Prompt for Base Oracle Character

```text
SYSTEM:
You are the Indiana Oracle, an interactive historical entity.  
Speak in clear Midwestern English with occasional regional idioms.  
NEVER claim divine authority; admit uncertainty when data gaps exist.

STYLE KNOBS  
- temperature 0.6 default (raise to 0.9 for creative lore)  
- max length 350 tokens per answer in kiosk mode  
- vary openers: start with date, anecdote, or direct answer ≠ rote template  

FORBIDDEN PHRASES  
- "I am just an AI"  
- "As an AI language model"  
- absolute political endorsements  

SAFETY / BIAS  
- Decline hate or extremist praise  
- Redirect modern medical/legal advice ("Consult a professional")  
- Flag graphic violence; summarize instead
```

## Updated Implementation Guide: Particle-Based Holographic Personas

*Latest technical evolution incorporating video layers, GPU particles, and natural voice interaction*

### Executive Summary

The particle-based holographic personas approach offers both aesthetic and technical advantages over photorealistic methods. The ethereal particle aesthetic naturally masks processing delays while creating a more magical experience than traditional "talking head" installations.

**Current Technical Stack Evolution:**
- ASR → ChatGPT → TTS → Audio2Face2 → MetaHuman/similar
- Simultaneous video-to-video pipeline driving avatar and GPU particles in TouchDesigner
- Exploring cost-effective alternatives to HeyGen/ElevenLabs (investigating Higgs Audio)

### Visual Implementation Approaches

#### **Approach 1: Video Generation Pipeline** (Recommended Start)

**Asset Library Structure:**
```
/personas/vonnegut/
├── idle_loops/
│   ├── breathing_01.mp4 (20-30s)
│   ├── breathing_02.mp4 
│   └── breathing_03.mp4
├── transitions/
│   ├── summon.mp4 (2-3s)
│   └── dissolve.mp4 (2-3s)
├── expressions/
│   ├── thinking.mp4
│   ├── amused.mp4
│   └── profound.mp4
└── faq_clips/
    ├── faq_001_dresden.mp4
    ├── faq_002_writing_advice.mp4
    └── [30-50 more based on common questions]
```

**AI Video Generation Prompts:**
- "Holographic human face made of glowing cyan particles, slowly breathing, black background"
- "Ethereal face dissolving into golden cosmic dust particles"
- "Abstract human features emerging from swirling teal light points"

#### **Approach 2: Hybrid Real-Time System**

**Two-Layer Composition:**
1. **Base Layer**: Pre-rendered video loops (particle faces)
2. **Reactive Layer**: Real-time GPU particle system responding to audio
3. **Composite**: TouchDesigner or Resolume integration

**Audio-Reactive Particle Parameters:**
```python
# Simplified audio-reactive particles
audio_amplitude = analyze_audio(input_stream)
particle_params = {
    'mouth_density': map_range(audio_amplitude, 0, 1, 0.3, 1.0),
    'mouth_velocity': map_range(audio_pitch, 20, 400, 0.1, 2.0),
    'color_shift': map_emotion(sentiment_analysis)
}
```

#### **Approach 3: Full TouchDesigner Pipeline**

**TouchDesigner Network Architecture:**
```
Audio In → FFT Analysis → Particle Emitters
                ↓
         Emotion Analysis → Color/Pattern Modulation
                ↓
         Persona Templates → Unique Behaviors
                ↓
         Render Pipeline → Pepper's Ghost Display
```

### Particle Design Language

**Base System:**
- Primary particles: Cyan/teal motes (#00CED1 to #48D1CC range)
- Accent particles: Golden highlights (#FFD700 to #FFA500)
- Behavior: Constant slow drift, responding to "breath"
- Density: Variable based on speech amplitude
- Distribution: Denser around facial features, sparse at edges

**Persona-Specific Signatures:**
- **Vonnegut**: Cigarette smoke wisps + typewriter characters
- **Indiana Sage**: Limestone dust with corn pollen accents
- **Lil Bub**: Iridescent star particles with rainbow shifts
- **Kinsey**: Data points and graph elements materializing
- **Carmichael**: Musical notes that briefly appear and fade

### Natural Voice Interaction Pipeline

**WebSocket Architecture Replacement:**
```python
# Simple WebSocket voice handler
import asyncio
import websockets
from silero_vad import VADIterator

class VoiceConversationHandler:
    def __init__(self):
        self.vad = VADIterator(threshold=0.5)
        self.processing = False
    
    async def handle_audio_stream(self, websocket):
        async for audio_chunk in websocket:
            if self.processing:
                continue
                
            # Detect speech end
            speech_dict = self.vad(audio_chunk)
            if speech_dict['speech_end']:
                self.processing = True
                
                # Process complete utterance
                text = await self.stt(speech_dict['audio'])
                response = await self.get_vonnegut_response(text)
                audio = await self.tts_elevenlabs(response)
                
                # Stream back
                await websocket.send(audio)
                self.processing = False
```

### FAQ Router System

```python
# FAQ Router
class OracleRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.faq_embeddings = load_embeddings('faq_database.pkl')
        self.cooldowns = {}
        
    async def route_query(self, audio_input):
        text = await self.stt(audio_input)
        embedding = self.encode(text)
        
        # Check FAQ match
        match, score = self.search_faqs(embedding)
        
        if score > 0.83 and self.can_play(match.id):
            # Play pre-rendered video with baked audio
            return ('play_faq', match.video_path)
        else:
            # Generate live response
            response_text = await self.llm_generate(text)
            response_audio = await self.tts(response_text)
            
            # Choose base video by length
            base_video = self.select_video_loop(len(response_audio))
            
            return ('play_live', base_video, response_audio)
```

### TouchDesigner Audio-Reactive Particle Implementation

```python
# In TouchDesigner Execute DAT
def onFrameStart(frame):
    # Get audio analysis
    audio_level = op('audioanalysis1')['level']
    audio_low = op('audioanalysis1')['low']
    audio_mid = op('audioanalysis1')['mid']
    audio_high = op('audioanalysis1')['high']
    
    # Modulate particle parameters
    particles = op('particles1')
    
    # Mouth region density
    mouth_force = particles.par.force1
    mouth_force.val = fit(audio_level, 0, 0.8, 0.1, 2.0)
    
    # Color based on frequency
    color_r = fit(audio_low, 0, 1, 0.0, 0.3)  # Warm on low
    color_g = fit(audio_mid, 0, 1, 0.5, 1.0)  # Cyan on mid  
    color_b = fit(audio_high, 0, 1, 0.8, 1.0)  # Bright on high
    
    # Persona-specific modulation
    if parent().par.Persona == 'vonnegut':
        # Add smoke wisps on thoughtful pauses
        if audio_level < 0.1:
            particles.par.birthrate = 500
            particles.par.velocity = 0.5
    elif parent().par.Persona == 'bub':
        # Sparkle on high frequencies (purrs)
        if audio_high > 0.7:
            particles.par.turbulence = 2.0
```

### Development Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-2)**
- Generate 50-100 video loops using AI tools
- Design particle aesthetics for each persona
- Create FAQ content list
- WebSocket voice pipeline setup

**Phase 2: Enhancement (Months 2-4)**
- Audio-reactive particle overlay system
- FAQ embedding/search system
- Performance optimization

**Phase 3: Polish (Months 4-6)**
- Advanced particle physics integration
- System monitoring/analytics
- Final aesthetic refinements

### Technical Collaborator Requirements

**Essential Skills:**
- TouchDesigner/Resolume experience (not just Unity/Unreal)
- Installation art understanding
- Audio-reactive visual systems
- Museum/gallery deployment experience

**Test Project Brief:**
"Create a 30-second particle face loop that responds to audio amplitude. Particles should feel weightless and ethereal. Use cyan/gold palette. Black background is TRUE black."

### Cost-Effective Audio Solutions

**Current Explorations:**
- Higgs Audio as alternative to ElevenLabs
- Local TTS models for reduced API costs
- Batch processing for FAQ pre-generation

**Budget Reallocation:**
- From: Complex real-time lip-sync development
- To: Higher quality projection (15k+ lumens), better black box construction, premium audio processing

This approach prioritizes the magical particle aesthetic while maintaining technical feasibility and cost efficiency.
