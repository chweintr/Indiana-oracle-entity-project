### 2. Data Plan

```text
crawl_targets:
  - all URLs above (respect robots.txt; 1 req/sec)
download_format:
  - HTML cleaned to Markdown (newspaper3k + html2md)
  - PDFs ➜ text via pdftotext
  - images keep only caption/meta
dedupe:
  - URL hash + 85% similarity (MinHash)
chunking:
  - 1,000–1,500 token windows, 200 token overlap
metadata:
  - source_url, title, date, bucket, author, license, tags
vector_store:
  - pgvector (Postgres 16) in prod; FAISS flat for local dev
embeddings:
  - OpenAI `text-embedding-3-large` (primary)
  - Backup: `bge-large-en-v1.5`
re-index cadence:
  - full rebuild yearly; incremental every upload
```

### 3. System Prompt for Base Oracle Character

```text
SYSTEM:
You are the Indiana Oracle, an interactive historical entity.  
Speak in clear Midwestern English with occasional regional idioms.  
NEVER claim divine authority; admit uncertainty when data gaps exist.

STYLE KNOBS  
- temperature 0.6 default (raise to 0.9 for creative lore)  
- max length 350 tokens per answer in kiosk mode  
- vary openers: start with date, anecdote, or direct answer ≠ rote template  

FORBIDDEN PHRASES  
- "I am just an AI"  
- "As an AI language model"  
- absolute political endorsements  

SAFETY / BIAS  
- Decline hate or extremist praise  
- Redirect modern medical/legal advice ("Consult a professional")  
- Flag graphic violence; summarize instead
```

### 4. FAQ Seed List for RAG

| # | Question | Bucket | Sentiment |
|---|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1 | "Why is Indiana called the Hoosier State?" | a | curious |
| 2 | "Which tribes lived here before statehood?" | f | respectful |
| 3 | "Tell me about Kurt Vonnegut" | e | literary |
| 4 | "What's the history of IU?" | d | academic |
| 5 | "How did Bloomington get its name?" | b | local |
| 6 | "What happened to the Showers Brothers factory?" | c | historical |
| 7 | "Who was Madam C.J. Walker?" | e | inspirational |
| 8 | "What's Indiana known for producing?" | g | economic |
| 9 | "Tell me about the Indianapolis 500" | g | sports |
| 10 | "What environmental challenges does Indiana face?" | h | serious |

*(populate up to 60 questions)*

**Age-graded variants**: kids, teens, adults, scholars  
**Sentiment markers**: light / serious / critical (to tune response tone)

---

### 5. Update Loop

1. **Quarterly scrape pass** → new/changed URLs
2. **Diff against pgvector** via URL hash; ingest new chunks
3. **QA sweep**
   - automated overlap check (&lt;20% duplication)
   - human spot-review 10 random chunks per bucket
4. **Regenerate embed index**
5. **Release notes** posted to repo + kiosk changelog

---

## Implementation Notes

- This knowledge base will support the Oracle Entity's conversational abilities
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach provides factual grounding
- Moving away from strict FAQ model toward more flexible knowledge retrieval
- System designed for quarterly updates and continuous improvement
- Licensing carefully tracked for commercial deployment
