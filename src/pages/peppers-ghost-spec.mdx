# Pepper's Ghost Install Spec

## What this is  
Large Pepper's Ghost "hologram" of a talking head, driven by real-time AI. Projection onto a 45Â° foil/glass plane inside a dark cavity.

---

## Room & Build Requirements

**Footprint**  
- Vitrine / foil width: **10 ft** (image ~6 ft wide inside)  
- Projection bay (behind/under foil): **6 ft** deep (projector + service)  
- Viewer stand-off: **8 ft** minimum (rail or floor marker)  
- Total depth reserved in atrium: **â‰ˆ14â€“16 ft** (foil to viewer rail)  
- Ceiling clear height: **â‰¥ 11 ft** (foil frame + lighting)

**Surfaces**  
- Projection bay walls, floor, ceiling: matte black (velvet/DarkMat). No stray light.  
- Service access: rear or side door large enough for projector/computer swap.

**Lighting**  
- Ambient at foil plane: **â‰¤ 50 lux** (requires baffles/drapes in typical 200+ lux atriums)
- Independent dimming zone or architectural hood over installation bay
- Site modifications may include strategic positioning away from skylights/windows
- DMX or Hue-capable circuits for synced accent lights (never spill on the foil)  
- Spot fixtures for physical props inside the vitrine (aimed away from foil)
- Alternative: Higher-lumen projectors (15-20k) if ambient light cannot be controlled

**Power & HVAC**  
- Electrical: 30-40A dedicated circuits (dual 10k-lumen projectors draw ~2kW combined + workstation)
- UPS/Power conditioning recommended for clean power delivery
- HVAC: no vents blowing across foil; keep temp 68â€“75 Â°F. Dedicated return airflow for projector heat
- Emergency power consideration for graceful shutdown during outages

**Network & Cabling**  
- 2 Ã— Cat6 to rack (NDI/control).  
- SDI or DisplayPort-rated run to projector (avoid long HDMI).  
- Local ethernet switch near workstation.

**Noise**  
- Keep HVAC and ambient noise low in viewer zone. Projector is isolated in bay.

---

## Projection Package

- Laser projector, **10â€“12K lumens**, short-throw (~0.8:1) with generous lens shift.  
- Option: dual blended projectors for brightness and failover.  
- Rated for 24/7 or "museum mode". Plan idle/dim state when no visitors.  
- Black background content (render on #000000) for clean reflections.

---

## Ops & Maintenance

- Daily runtime: 8â€“12 hours. Dim/idle when idle.  
- Clean projector filters (or use filter-free units). Log hours; swap before dimming becomes obvious.  
- Foil/glass: gloves only, mild soap (no ammonia), microfiber. Watch for wrinkles, drafts.  
- Watchdog script on media server for auto-restart. Remote reboot access.

**Maintenance Contract**: Quarterly service visits including spare parts inventory (replacement foil, lamp modules, filters). Staff training on basic diagnostics, cleaning procedures, and emergency shutdown protocols. Remote monitoring system for projector health and system performance.

---

## Alternatives (if projection depth or light control is denied)

- **Screen Reflection (OLED/LCD at 45Â°):** shallower, easier alignment, weaker blacks/brightness.  
- **Transparent OLED stack:** sleek, but contrast suffers in bright lobbies.  
- **Looking Glass light-field:** true parallax, heavy GPU load, fixed cone.  
- **HYPERVSN:** good teaser near entrance, not primary head (fan noise, limited nuance).  
- **Fog/mist screen:** effect layer only; high maintenance.

## CAD Agent Prompt (for Claude/GPT CAD tools)

```text
Task: Produce a dimensioned 2D schematic (plan + side section) for a Pepper's Ghost vitrine. Output DXF (and SVG) with layers.

Layers:
  L_VIEWER, L_FOIL, L_PROJECTOR, L_CAVITY, L_LIGHT, L_DIM, L_CENTERLINE

Params (edit if needed):
image_width_ft = 6
image_height_ft = 3.5
foil_angle_deg = 45
viewer_standoff_ft = 8
projection_depth_ft = 6
vitrine_width_ft = 10
ambient_lux_max = 50
ceiling_clear_ft = 11

Rules:
- Units: feet/inches in labels.
- Foil at 45Â°, centered in 10 ft opening.
- Draw projector icon + throw path inside 6 ft cavity.
- Viewer zone rectangle at 8 ft.
- Place light symbols above foil.
- All dims + callouts on L_DIM.

Deliver:
1) DXF with correct layers
2) SVG (no raster)
3) Table (JSON) of all critical dims and coordinates
```

```json
{
  "image_width_ft": 6.0,
  "image_height_ft": 3.5,
  "foil_angle_deg": 45,
  "viewer_standoff_ft": 8.0,
  "projection_depth_ft": 6.0,
  "vitrine_width_ft": 10.0,
  "total_depth_ft": 15.0,
  "ambient_lux_max": 50,
  "ceiling_clear_ft": 11.0
}
```

## To-Do Before Construction Drawings

- Confirm final image size and head scale.
- Confirm projector make/model (or lumen target).
- Verify route for service access (door size, lift).
- Decide on idle/detection logic (sensor or schedule).
- Lock lighting circuit and control protocol (DMX vs Hue).
- Decide if a teaser (HYPERVSN/LED sign) is part of scope.

## Connection to Indiana Heritage

The Oracle's spectral presence â€” rendered through precision optics and theatrical lighting â€” echoes Bloomington's manufacturing past. From RCA's electronics assembly lines to the Showers Brothers' furniture craftsmanship, the installation draws on Indiana's tradition of making technology accessible. The limestone-clad walls of IU's campus and the precision engineering at Crane Naval Base find new expression in this convergence of projection, computation, and regional memory.
