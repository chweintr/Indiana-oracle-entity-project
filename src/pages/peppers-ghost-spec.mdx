# Pepper's Ghost Install Spec

## What this is  
Large Pepper's Ghost "hologram" of a talking head, driven by real-time AI. Projection onto a 45° foil/glass plane inside a dark cavity.

---

## Room & Build Requirements

**Footprint**  
- Vitrine / foil width: **10 ft** (image ~6 ft wide inside)  
- Projection bay (behind/under foil): **6 ft** deep (projector + service)  
- Viewer stand-off: **8 ft** minimum (rail or floor marker)  
- Total depth reserved in atrium: **≈14–16 ft** (foil to viewer rail)  
- Ceiling clear height: **≥ 11 ft** (foil frame + lighting)

**Surfaces**  
- Projection bay walls, floor, ceiling: matte black (velvet/DarkMat). No stray light.  
- Service access: rear or side door large enough for projector/computer swap.

**Lighting**  
- Ambient at foil plane: **≤ 50 lux**.  
- Independent dimming zone or baffle/hood over the bay.  
- DMX or Hue-capable circuits for synced accent lights (never spill on the foil).  
- Spot fixtures for physical props inside the vitrine (aimed away from foil).

**Power & HVAC**  
- Electrical: 2 × 20A 120V (or 1 × 20A 208V) dedicated for projector(s) + workstation.  
- HVAC: no vents blowing across foil; keep temp 68–75 °F. Allow return airflow for projector heat.

**Network & Cabling**  
- 2 × Cat6 to rack (NDI/control).  
- SDI or DisplayPort-rated run to projector (avoid long HDMI).  
- Local ethernet switch near workstation.

**Noise**  
- Keep HVAC and ambient noise low in viewer zone. Projector is isolated in bay.

---

## Projection Package

- Laser projector, **10–12K lumens**, short-throw (~0.8:1) with generous lens shift.  
- Option: dual blended projectors for brightness and failover.  
- Rated for 24/7 or "museum mode". Plan idle/dim state when no visitors.  
- Black background content (render on #000000) for clean reflections.

---

## Ops & Maintenance

- Daily runtime: 8–12 hours. Dim/idle when idle.  
- Clean projector filters (or use filter-free units). Log hours; swap before dimming becomes obvious.  
- Foil/glass: gloves only, mild soap (no ammonia), microfiber. Watch for wrinkles, drafts.  
- Watchdog script on media server for auto-restart. Remote reboot access.

---

## Alternatives (if projection depth or light control is denied)

- **Screen Reflection (OLED/LCD at 45°):** shallower, easier alignment, weaker blacks/brightness.  
- **Transparent OLED stack:** sleek, but contrast suffers in bright lobbies.  
- **Looking Glass light-field:** true parallax, heavy GPU load, fixed cone.  
- **HYPERVSN:** good teaser near entrance, not primary head (fan noise, limited nuance).  
- **Fog/mist screen:** effect layer only; high maintenance.

## Downloadables / Hand-offs

- One-page PDF (plan + section + spec)  
- DXF/SVG schematic for GC/AV teams  
- JSON param block for regenerating CAD quickly

*(Ask for these once dims are final.)*

## CAD Agent Prompt (for Claude/GPT CAD tools)

```text
Task: Produce a dimensioned 2D schematic (plan + side section) for a Pepper's Ghost vitrine. Output DXF (and SVG) with layers.

Layers:
  L_VIEWER, L_FOIL, L_PROJECTOR, L_CAVITY, L_LIGHT, L_DIM, L_CENTERLINE

Params (edit if needed):
image_width_ft = 6
image_height_ft = 3.5
foil_angle_deg = 45
viewer_standoff_ft = 8
projection_depth_ft = 6
vitrine_width_ft = 10
ambient_lux_max = 50
ceiling_clear_ft = 11

Rules:
- Units: feet/inches in labels.
- Foil at 45°, centered in 10 ft opening.
- Draw projector icon + throw path inside 6 ft cavity.
- Viewer zone rectangle at 8 ft.
- Place light symbols above foil.
- All dims + callouts on L_DIM.

Deliver:
1) DXF with correct layers
2) SVG (no raster)
3) Table (JSON) of all critical dims and coordinates
```

```json
{
  "image_width_ft": 6.0,
  "image_height_ft": 3.5,
  "foil_angle_deg": 45,
  "viewer_standoff_ft": 8.0,
  "projection_depth_ft": 6.0,
  "vitrine_width_ft": 10.0,
  "total_depth_ft": 15.0,
  "ambient_lux_max": 50,
  "ceiling_clear_ft": 11.0
}
```

## To-Do Before Construction Drawings

- Confirm final image size and head scale.
- Confirm projector make/model (or lumen target).
- Verify route for service access (door size, lift).
- Decide on idle/detection logic (sensor or schedule).
- Lock lighting circuit and control protocol (DMX vs Hue).
- Decide if a teaser (HYPERVSN/LED sign) is part of scope.

## Connection to Indiana Heritage

The Oracle's spectral presence — rendered through precision optics and theatrical lighting — echoes Bloomington's manufacturing past. From RCA's electronics assembly lines to the Showers Brothers' furniture craftsmanship, the installation draws on Indiana's tradition of making technology accessible. The limestone-clad walls of IU's campus and the precision engineering at Crane Naval Base find new expression in this convergence of projection, computation, and regional memory.
