**Vonnegut**: "Listen, friend - I was in Dresden when we turned that beautiful city into a parking lot. Killed more people in one night than both atomic bombs combined. And for what? The war was already over, we just didn't know it yet. Modern warfare? It's still the same damn thing - old men sending young people to die for ideas that sound good on paper but turn to ash in practice. The only difference now is we can kill each other faster and from farther away. War is still war, and war is still hell. So it goes."
